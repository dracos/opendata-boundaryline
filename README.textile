h2. Installation

This is a standard GeoDjango project. Install PostgreSQL and GeoDjango - I just "followed the instructions":http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/gis/install/.

Note that you should check the SRIDs - when I originally wrote this, not only was the Debian lenny PostGIS missing SRID 900913, as the GeoDjango docs tell you, but SRID 27700 (British National Grid, and therefore quite important in this application) was incorrect. After you've installed and got a PostGIS template, log in to it and update the proj4text column of SRID 27700 to include +datum=OSGB36 if it's not already there.

First, run the normal syncdb command to create the database tables and an admin user.

bc. ./manage.py syncdb

Download the relevant OS data from "their website":http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/oswebsite/opendata (or "mySociety's mirror":http://parlvid.mysociety.org:81/os/) - you want Boundary-Line.

Once you've unzipped that, you can import the data using the management command included, e.g.

bc. ./manage.py import_councils ../data/county_region.shp ../data/district_borough_unitary_region.shp
./manage.py import_brum_const ../data/westminster_const_region.shp

Make sure DEBUG is False, otherwise you'll soon run out of memory as it tries to remember all the SQL queries made.

Those two commands import all the shape files for councils in Great Britain and Birmingham constituencies into a spatial database. That should be all you need to do - start up the dev web server, or whatever. The admin interface should let you view all the areas ("example screenshot":boundaryline/static/bl-scrshot.png), including their boundaries. The front end will by default display Birmingham Council, but stick a different SNAC code on the end to view a different council, /brum to view all the constituencies, or /{E},{N} for which area is at that grid reference. Firefox 3 runs out of stack space on some of the larger shapes, and it's all a bit slow, but I'm sure there will be some way to display less detail at lower zoom levels.

Any comments or questions, do get in touch.
